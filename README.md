# Healthcare Data Analysis Project

**Description:**

This project uses SQL to analyze healthcare data to provide insights that can directly address hospital concerns regarding resource allocation and patient care effectiveness. The analysis focuses on understanding patient demographics, diagnostic trends, visit patterns, lab results, and readmission rates to optimize service delivery and improve patient outcomes.

**Project Goals and Relevance to the Hospital:**

This project aims to provide the hospital with actionable information to improve its operations and patient care. It addresses key questions and delivers findings across several areas:

* **Understanding Patient Demographics:**
    * **Analysis:** Determines the age and gender distribution of the patient population.
    * **SQL Query:** See `age_group_analysis.sql`
    * **Findings & Analysis for Stakeholders:**
        * **Insights:**
            * Provides the distribution of patients across age groups (Pediatric: <18, Adult: 18-64, Senior: >65) and genders.
            * Identifies the percentage of patients in each age group and gender category.
        * **Hospital Benefit:**
            * **Resource Allocation:**
                * If a large portion of the population is senior, resources can be directed towards geriatric care, specialized equipment, and staff training.
                * If there's a significant pediatric population, ensuring adequate pediatric specialists and facilities is crucial.
            * **Service Planning:**
                * Tailoring healthcare services to the specific needs of different age groups and genders. For example, offering preventive screenings relevant to specific demographics.
            * **Marketing & Outreach:**
                * Developing targeted health education materials and outreach programs based on the demographic profile.

* **Diagnosis Prevalence Analysis:**
    * **Analysis:** Identifies prevalent diagnoses and their distribution across different patient groups.
    * **SQL Query:** See `diagnosis_age_analysis.sql`
    * **Findings & Analysis for Stakeholders:**
        * **Insights:**
            * Reveals the most common diagnoses within the patient population.
            * Shows how diagnoses vary by age and gender.
            * For example, it might identify that a certain diagnosis is more prevalent in a specific age group or gender.
        * **Hospital Benefit:**
            * **Resource Allocation:**

            * **Patient Flow Management:**
                * Reducing patient wait times by optimizing scheduling and patient flow.
                * Improving patient satisfaction by minimizing delays and congestion.
            * **Resource Allocation:**
                * Allocating rooms, equipment, and other resources based on peak usage times.

* **Lab Result Analysis:**
    * **Analysis:** Identifies patients with abnormal lab results (e.g., Fasting Blood Sugar) for early intervention.
    * **SQL Query:** See `fasting_blood_sugar_analysis.sql`
    * **Findings & Analysis for Stakeholders:**
        * **Insights:**
            * Flags patients with lab results outside the normal range (e.g., Fasting Blood Sugar < 70 or > 100 mg/dL).
            * Identifies specific patients needing attention.
        * **Hospital Benefit:**
            * **Early Detection & Intervention:**
                * Enables timely follow-up and treatment to prevent disease progression and complications.

**Technical Approach:**

* The project uses SQL to query and analyze data from a relational database.
* SQL queries are provided for both SQL Server and PostgreSQL.

**Data Source:**

* The data is sourced from a relational database, likely containing tables such as `Patients`, `Outpatient Visits`, and `Lab Results`.

**Project Files:**

* The SQL queries are organized into separate files for each analysis (e.g., `age_group_analysis.sql`, `readmission_analysis.sql`).

**To use the project:**

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Review the SQL files to understand the analysis logic.
3.  Execute the queries against your database system (SQL Server or PostgreSQL).
4.  Use the results to inform hospital operations and patient care strategies.
